# ocrapp

This is a simple Ocr app which is used to convert image to text using the tesseract library(Tess - two).

The assumptions that i have made are that the images that are uploaded by user are machine printed only not at all hand-written.

As you entered hand-written image or any other image the app will break down showing the exception as exception handling is done there

I would say prefer Arial font written images as that are best converted in this ocr.As i have tested for other font also it is not working that well.

You have to use threads in order to make it function in an efficient manner otherwise the app will get down easily showing app not responding if some big image is uplaoded.

Note : The quality of the image that you have should be high otherwise the output given by the reader will not be correct....
